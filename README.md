# LoginPractice
 
A simple login system. My big goal here was to get the bool to work outside of the main and also to make a function .txt save system to the folder. There should be a test login information on this and anything you add with this will save locally to the file on your computer. A big thing I learned in this was the "ifstream" input. Normally I would use "cin" but in this case I needed something to save it to a text file if you ever wanted to "login" again. So i need the ifstream to read from the file. Of course since I learned about the ifstream for a login system if I wanted it to call back to the login information added to the text file I also needed to learn ofstream so it would read and open the file.
